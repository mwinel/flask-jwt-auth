# flask-jwt-auth
A test-first approach to implementing token-based authentication in a Flask app using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). JSON Web Tokens (or JWTs) provide a means of transmitting information from the client to the server in a stateless, secure way.

## Objectives
- Implement user authentication with JWTs
- Blacklist user tokens when necessary
- Write tests to create and verify JWTs and user authentication
- Practice test-driven development
